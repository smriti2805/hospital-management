This is a simple **console-based Hospital Management System** built in Python. It allows hospital staff to manage patients across various specializations based on urgency levels.

## ✨ Features

* ➕ Add new patients with urgency levels:

  * 🟢 0: Normal
  * 🟡 1: Urgent
  * 🔴 2: Super Urgent
* 📋 View patients in all specializations
* 👨‍⚕️ Get the next patient based on priority
* ❌ Remove a leaving patient
* 🧪 Dummy data is preloaded for testing

## 📁 Directory Structure

```

└── hms.py
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher

### ▶️ Running the Program

```bash
python hms.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the application.

## 🧠 Code Structure

### `🩺 Patient` Class

Represents individual patients with name and urgency status. Supports sorting by urgency.

### `🏢 HospitalManger` Class

Contains core logic for managing patients by specialization. Handles adding, removing, and retrieving patients.

### `🖥️ FrontendManager` Class

Handles user interaction through a menu-driven interface. Calls methods from `HospitalManger`.

## 🧾 Example Menu

```
Program Options:
1) Add new patient
2) Print all patients
3) Get next patient
4) Remove a leaving patient
5) End the program
```

## 📝 Notes

* Each specialization can have a maximum of 10 patients.
* Patients are automatically sorted based on urgency.
* Sorting is stable; patients with the same urgency retain their order.
